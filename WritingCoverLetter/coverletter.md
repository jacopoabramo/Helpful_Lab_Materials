Dear Reviewers of the Essential Open Source Software for Science,

Modern microscopes necessitate a seamless integration of multiple hardware components and subsequent image processing, all within a user-friendly interface. This allows researchers to concentrate on scientific inquiries rather than technical challenges. ImSwitch is designed to offer extensive versatility across various microscopy modalities. It emphasizes experiment reproducibility and compatibility with diverse hardware and image processing frameworks. Recently, ImSwitch has cultivated an active user base. The next pivotal step is enhancing the software's robustness and user experience.

This letter is to affirm our collective endorsement of ImSwitch as an ideal recipient for this grant. Funding would enable the expansion of ImSwitch's outreach and the fortification of its core functionalities.

ImSwitch is committed to democratizing microscopy control, making it more accessible to both experienced scientific developers and newcomers to the scientific community. Our goal is to bridge the gap between these groups, fostering a broader community engaged in the advancement of smart, open-source microscopy control.

We appreciate your consideration and thank you in advance for your support.
